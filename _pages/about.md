<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a final year graduate student from [School of Transportation](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gang Ren](https://tc.seu.edu.cn/2019/1022/c25722a291836/page.htm) from Southeast University, and [Prof. Chenyang Wu](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2023010029) from Northwestern Polytechnical University.

My research interest includes travel behavior, choice modelling, choice experiment, multimodal transportation, and mobility service. I have published several papers in relevant areas with total google scholar citations  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=psLnv6sAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
